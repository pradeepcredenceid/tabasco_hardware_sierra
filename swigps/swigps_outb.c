 *      This function is only called if there was no error code
 *      contained in the incoming packet header. 
 * 
 *      Other than storing the GPS port name into the state structure
 *      and marking the name as initialized, this function has no other
 *      effect. 
 *
 *      The NMEA port handle is a key component in whether this Vendor-
 *      specific GPS code will allow its "start()" interface function to
 *      be called. If the handle is unknown at the time of the start() 
 *      call then an error is returned to the interface's owner. 
 *
 *      Furthermore, the ENGINE ON status is not sent to the interface's
 *      owner until the GPS handle is returned. A properly designed 
 *      GPS Location Service ought not to call any more interface functions
 *      until the ENGINE ON status is received.
