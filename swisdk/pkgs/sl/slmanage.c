 *
 * Purpose: Converts the initial part of the string
 *          pointed to by "sp" from ASCII hex to swi_uint32.
 *          This function performs an equivalent duty
 *          as slatol() except that slahtol() is for
 *          converting ASCII hexadecimal strings rather
 *          than for converting ASCII decimal strings.
 *             
 * Parms:   sp - pointer to string to convert
 *
 * Return:  A swi_uint32 conversion of the parameter "sp" 
 *
 * Abort:   None (No fatal errors)
 *
 * Notes:   If sp does not contain a valid hexadecimal number, 
 *          zero is returned. If the result cannot be represented 
 *          as a swi_uint32 due to overflow problems, SLUINT32MAX is 
 *          returned.  Non-hex input (e.g. "G") is ignored (no 
 *          error is returned) if this does not occur at where sp 
 *          is pointed to.
