 *          MMPOOLEMPTY - All the free blocks in the pool have been allocated

/*
 * Name:    mmpool
 *
 * Purpose: This definition is provided so that users can allocate
 *          sufficient storage for their memory pool structures.
 *          However, users are forbidden from manipulating the
 *          contents of this structure and can only pass a pointer
 *          to it into MM package global functions when
 *          required.
 *
 * Members: mmnextp - Pointer to the pool header structure of the
 *                    neighbouring pool (optional for debugging)
 *          mmfreep - Pointer to the free block list.
 *          mmnamep - Pointer to a NULL-terminated character string
 *                    containing the name of this pool
 *          mmvalid - A sentinel value that indicates whether the
 *                    pool has been initialized or not
 *          mmnumbks- Number of blocks in the pool
 *          mmblocksz - Size of the User-portion of each block
 *          mmfirstp - Address of the first block for debugging purpose
 *          mmlastp - Address of the last block in the pool
 *          mmsemaph - Semaphore used to make accessing a pool a thread-
 *                    safe operation
 *          mmblog  - flag to mark pool for logging
 *
 * Notes:   The free list is implemented as a singly-linked list
 *          so that the "mmfreep" points to the *last* block in
 *          the list and the last block always points to the
 *          first block in the list.
 *
 *          The "mmbufhdr" pointer is defined within the mmidefs.h
 *          file and external packages don't need to know about it
