 *              There may be multiple user-mode processes needing to
 *              exchange information with the SDK. The contents of this

 *
 * Name: icapi_rcv
 *
 * Purpose: Allows callers in the API-side to wait for an
 *          incoming IPC message
 *
 * Parms:   ipccbp     - Pointer to a previously-initialized IPC
 *                       control block
 *          ipcbufp    - (IN/OUT) Pointer to a caller-supplied
 *                       buffer into which an incoming IPC message
 *                       is placed
 *          ipcbuflenp - (IN)  Storage available in the incoming
 *                             buffer
 *                       (OUT) Length, in bytes, of the incoming
 *                             message
 *          timeout    - Length of time (ms) to wait for the receive
 *                       to complete. 0 to wait forever
 *
 * Return:  TRUE  - message received and stored into buffer space provided
 *          FALSE - Timeout occurred. No change to message storage space
 *
 * Abort:   none
 *
 * Notes:   The IPC channel must have been previously opened before
 *          using this call.
 *          When swi_osapiipcread() returns TRUE with a buffer length
 *          of ZERO, it indicates that the operation has timed out.
